/**
 * Class SassCompiler
 *
 * This simple tool compiles all .scss files in folder A to .css files (with exactly the same name) into folder B.
 * Everything happens right when you run your app, on-the-fly, in pure PHP. No Ruby needed, no configuration needed.
 *
 * SassWatcher is not a standalone compiler, it's just a little method that uses the excellent scssphp compiler written
 * by Leaf Corcoran (https://twitter.com/moonscript), which can be found here: http://leafo.net/scssphp/ and adds
 * automatic compiling to it.
 *
 * The currently supported version of SCSS syntax is 3.2.12, which is the latest one.
 * To avoid confusion: SASS is the name of the language itself, and also the "name" of the "first" version of the
 * syntax (which was quite different than CSS). Then SASS's syntax was changed to "SCSS", which is more like CSS, but
 * with awesome additional possibilities and features.
 *
 * The compiler uses the SCSS syntax, which is recommended and mostly used. The old SASS syntax is not supported.
 *
 * @see SASS Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_%28stylesheet_language%29
 * @see SASS Homepage: http://sass-lang.com/
 * @see scssphp, the used compiler (in PHP): http://leafo.net/scssphp/
